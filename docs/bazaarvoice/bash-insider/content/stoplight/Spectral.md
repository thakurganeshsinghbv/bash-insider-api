### ðŸ§° Installation and Usage

# OR

#### Create a Ruleset

Spectral, being a generic YAML/JSON linter, needs a ruleset in order to be able to lint files. You can learn more about the rulesets here.

If you intend to lint an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI document, we have a few predefined rulesets you can extend to get Spectral up and running. To reference them, you can run the following command:

```json
echo '{\n\t"extends": ["spectral:oas", "spectral:asyncapi"]\n}' > .spectral.json

```

#### Lint

```json
spectral lint petstore.yaml

```
