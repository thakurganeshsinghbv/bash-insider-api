# What Is OpenAPI?

OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe your entire API, including:

- Available endpoints (`/users`) and operations on each endpoint (`GET /users`, `POST /users`)
- Operation parameters Input and output for each operation
- Authentication methods
- Contact information, license, terms of use and other information.
API specifications can be written in YAML or JSON. The format is easy to learn and readable to both humans and machines. The complete OpenAPI Specification can be found on GitHub: [OpenAPI 3.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md)

# Why Use OpenAPI?
The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in OpenAPI. Once written, an OpenAPI specification and Swagger tools can drive your API development further in various ways:

- Design-first users: use [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/) to **generate a server stub** for your API. The only thing left is to implement the server logic â€“ and your API is ready to go live!
- Use Swagger Codegen to **generate client libraries** for your API in over 40 languages.
- Use Swagger UI to generate **interactive API documentation** that lets your users try out the API calls directly in the browser.
- Use the spec to connect API-related tools to your API. For example, import the spec to SoapUI to create automated tests for your API. 

# Basic Structure
You can write OpenAPI definitions in YAML or JSON. In this guide, we use only YAML examples but JSON works equally well. A sample OpenAPI 3.0 definition written in YAML looks like:

```json
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Sample API
  description: Optional multiline or single-line description in [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) or HTML.
  version: 0.1.9
servers:
  - url: http://api.example.com/v1
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Main (production) server
  - url: http://staging-api.example.com
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Internal staging server for testing
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      description: Optional extended description in CommonMark or HTML.
      responses:
        '200':    # status code
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: array
                items: 
                  type: string
```

## Paths

The paths section defines individual endpoints (paths) in your API, and the HTTP methods (operations) supported by these endpoints. For example, GET /users can be described as:

```json
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      description: Optional extended description in CommonMark or HTML
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema: 
                type: array
                items: 
                  type: string
```

## Parameters

Operations can have parameters passed via URL path (/users/{userId}), query string (/users?role=admin), headers (X-CustomHeader: Value) or cookies (Cookie: debug=0). You can define the parameter data types, format, whether they are required or optional, and other details:

```json
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Returns a user by ID.
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          description: Parameter description in CommonMark or HTML.
          schema:
            type : integer
            format: int64
            minimum: 1
      responses: 
        '200':
          description: OK
```
## Request Body
If an operation sends a request body, use the requestBody keyword to describe the body content and media type.

```json
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      summary: Creates a user.
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                username:
                  type: string
      responses: 
        '201':
          description: Created
```
